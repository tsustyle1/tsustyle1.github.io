### Port Scanning and Enumeration (Nmap, FTP)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)
  * [FTP](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ftp)

`nmap -sV -sC -oN nmap/initial -T4 10.10.17.233`

FTP and SSH. Looks like FTP has anonymous login. Let's start with that.

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/ftp.png)


Logging in with the user: anonymous and password: anonymous, we browse the system and see a couple files: .creds (hidden) and test.txt
Grab them using the command: get

### Pythonian Pickles served by the Cyber Chef

  * [Python Pickle Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

So we have this .creds file, catting it out we're flooded with '1's and '0's. Binary? Bacon? Probably binary. Let's check with Cyber Chef.

Note: *Download* the output as a file, do not copy and paste it.

…ssh_pass
…ssh_user

That sounds really interesting. Now is the time to click the link above 'Python Pickle Module'. This is definitely a pickled object. Let's write a script to handle this.

![script](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/script.png)

Script I wrote to handle unpickling and formatting the text so that it's readable.

### Little Pickle: Gherkin
* Reading/Resources

  * [Python Bytecode](https://opensource.com/article/18/4/introduction-python-bytecode)
  
  
  
So now that we're on the box, let's capture the user fl - -…?

![script](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/initaccess.png)

or… maybe not

Okay, so that's out. But we did notice a random file owned by root in our directory. We can't execute it, but we can transfer it to our machine and decompile it using Uncompyle6

![script](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/bigscript.png)

I see.. this creates a service on port 7321. Once connected, it asks for a username and password. If successful, it runs commands. Nice.

We see the username and password stored at the top. Let's use the remote machine to grab those really quick.

![creds](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/getcreds.png)

Alright, now we'll try to connect to that service

![dill](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/dill.png)

Now that we have command execution, what can we find?

![looking](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/cmd.png)

Ooooh. SSH directory

![ssh](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/sshkey.png)

I spy a private ssh key

![privatekey](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/sshkey2.png)

Let's copy that down, save it, and give it the right permissions


`chmod 600 dill_id_rsa`

`ssh -i dill_id_rsa dill@10.10.17.233`

### Big Pickle: Dill
* Reading/Resources
  * [Python Pickle Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
  * [Pickle Shell](http://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-11/Slaviero/BH_US_11_Slaviero_Sour_Pickles_WP.pdf)
  * [Base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64)
  
  
  
Now that we're on Dill's account, let's finally capture that user flag!

![userflag](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/userflag.png)

Now let's set our eyes on the biggest pickle of them all: root

The way this box is going, I'm not imagining any normal privesc vectors, but let's try anyways.

`sudo -l`

![sudo](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/sudo.png)

Oh hey! We can run… whatever that is as root without requiring a password! Let's see what it does!

![firsterror](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/firsterror.png)

Well, what if we gave it some base64?

![b64](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/b64.png)

![thirderror](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/thirderror.png)

But.. pic - wait, you can't grow pickles. You grow cucumbers.. WAIT! It probably takes a pickled object!

After browsing the internet for a while and learning all I can about the pickle module, I stumbled across this paper: Sour Pickles

Which lead me to this object, which I like to call..

PICKLES GONE BAD

![badpickle](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/picklesgonebad.png)

Pickles don't *usually* have shells. But this one, this one has GONE BAD

![badpickleb64](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/picklesgonebadb64.png)

base64 encoding that bad, bad pickle

![root](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/rootacquired.png)

And just like that, we get root! Let's capture the root fla - oh come on now.

![trollflag](/assets/images/thm/peakhill/trollflag.png)

but it's right there! Turns out, there's like, a space or something in front of it. Oh well. CAT ALL THE THINGS
