excerpt: "'Beep' is an easy rated box on Hack the Box. We'll be using public exploits from exploit DB to exploit both LFI and RCE on an old version of Elastix. Once we're in the box we'll abuse an outdated version of Nmap to escalate our privileges."

### Port Scanning and Enumeration (Nmap)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap manual](https://nmap.org/book/man.html)

`nmap -sV -sC -oN nmap/initial -T4 10.10.10.7`

`nmap -p- 10.10.10.7 -oN nmap/allports`

Lots of stuff to look at here. Let's check out the webserver first

Couldn't find any default creds. Let's keep enumerating.

What's on 10000?

### Access (Elastix: LFI and RCE, exploitdb, elastix)
* Reading/Resources
  * [elastix](https://www.elastix.org/)
  * [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
  * [Elastix LFI](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37637)
  * [Elastix RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18650)
  
  
Searching exploitdb for 'elastix' we can see that there's a few vulnerabilities. Some require authentication, so let's try the LFI vulnerability using graph.php and current_language.  

Using the supplied exploit, we're given a config file

Let's try to log in to Elastix using those creds


Nice, it worked. Maybe one of those vulnerabilities that required some sort of auth will work now?

So this one requires an extension. Let's check the PBX tab.

So, now that we have an extension, let's sub in our details for extension, lhost and lport, fire up a listener on our machine and let her rip.

### Privesc (Nmap interactive)
* Reading/Resources
  * [Nmap's old Interactive mode](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#sudo)

Now that we're on the box, let's see about privesc. sudo -l

Nmap? Let's look at [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/#sudo)

And we're root! Let's capture the flags
